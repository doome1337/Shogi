Part II: 
Vision statement:
    Create a program that simulates the gameplay of Shogi.
    Graphic representation of the game. 
        Display the board in a graphical, easy to undertand format.
Features:
    Display the board. 
    Display valid moves.
        Marks the tiles where a given pieces can move.
        Will be optional.
    User can select possible moves, and is only allowed to select possible moves.
    The rules of the game are known to the computer, so impossible moves are not allowed by the program.
Possible features: 
    Drag-and-drop. 
        The user can click on a given piece, and drag it onto the tile he wants to move it onto.
        Can also drag pieces from his drop table onto the the board.
    Customizable options.
        Textures can be swapped by the user.
    Music.
        Highly unlikely, but still could be interesting.
    Custom games.
        Games with special rules.
        Missions: Levels with a lesser amount of pieces. Unlikely to be implemented.
        Could possibly work with user created ones.
Non-features:
    AI. Seriously. We won't even attempt it.
